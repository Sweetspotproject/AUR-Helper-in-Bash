# AUR Finder

This is a bit tool for help you to download programs of AUR but without install any AUR Helper heavy.

#
# Installation
1 - Create a directory to download the script or download it anywhere.

2 - Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/Sweetspotproject/AUR-Helper-in-Bash.git

3 - Add the location of the script to the path inside the .zshrc or .bashrc file, as follows:

This depends on the names of your directories.

For .zshrc:

    export PATH="/home/YourUser/RouteToDirectory/AUR-Helper-in-Bash:$PATH"

For .bashrc:

    export PATH="/home/YourUser/RouteToDirectory/AUR-Helper-in-Bash:$PATH"


4 - Simply type source .zshrc or source .bashrc to update the file and that's it, you can use it in your terminal.
